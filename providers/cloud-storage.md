# Cloud Storage

If you are currently using a Cloud Storage Service like Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive or Apple iCloud, you are putting complete trust in your service provider to not look at your files.

Consider reducing the need to trust your provider, by using an alternative below that supports [end-to-end encryption](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption) (E2EE).
## â€Ž
## Nextcloud
> 
> Nextcloud is a suite of free and open-source client-server software for creating your own file hosting services on a private server you control. It also comes with experimental end-to-end encryption (E2EE).
> 
> We recommend checking if your Nextcloud provider supports E2EE, otherwise you have to trust the provider to not look at your files.
> 
> When self hosting Nextcloud, you should also remember to enable E2EE to protect against your hosting provider from snooping on your data.
